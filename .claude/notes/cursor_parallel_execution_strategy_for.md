# Parallel execution strategy for migration plan
_Exported on 6/14/2025 at 04:11:43 CDT from Cursor (1.1.2)_

**User**

Achieving true parallel execution for different parts of your migration plan, especially when aiming for two complete parallel versions, is an advanced workflow that involves careful git management and potentially running multiple Claude Code instances.

Here's a strategy that combines bash scripting for setup and Claude Code custom commands for execution:

**Overall Strategy:**

1.  **Plan Modification:** I'll first update your plan files (`.claude/spec/*.md`) to:
    *   Use `pnpm` for consistency (as your example script uses `bun`, and `init-parallel` uses `pnpm`).
    *   Include explicit "commit changes" steps at the end of each major phase (P1, P2A, P2B, P2C, P2D) to ensure work is saved on the correct branches before proceeding.
2.  **Bash Script for P2 Worktree Setup:** I'll provide a bash script (`setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh`). This script will be run *after* the initial P1 (Core Setup) phase is completed for a version. It will create the necessary separate git worktrees for the P2A, P2B, P2C, and P2D tasks, branching from the P1-completed state.
3.  **Claude Code Execution:** You'll use your custom commands (`@/init-parallel` and `@/execute-single-plan`) in a structured way. For parallel P2 tasks, you'll need to run them in separate terminals, each with its own Claude Code session.
4.  **Manual Git Merging:** After the parallel P2 tasks are complete, you'll manually merge their branches back into the main worktree for that version.
5.  **Finalization:** Run the P3 plan.

This process will be repeated for each of the two versions you want to create.

**Step 1: Modifying Your Plan Files**

I'll make the following changes:

*   **In `.claude/spec/P1-core.md`:**
    *   Task 0.1: `npm install ...` will become `pnpm add @azure/data-tables stytch patreon stripe zod @upstash/ratelimit @vercel/kv`.
    *   Task 0.2: `npm install -D ...` will become `pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/ui jsdom`.
    *   A new task will be added at the end of Phase 1:
        ```markdown
        - [ ] **Task 1.3: Commit Core Setup**
          - [ ] Commit all changes to the current branch with the message "P1: Core services and environment setup complete".
        ```
*   **In `.claude/spec/P2A-users-app.md`, `.claude/spec/P2B-auth-blog.md`, `.claude/spec/P2C-oauth.md`, `.claude/spec/P2D-admin-stripe-etc.md`:**
    *   A new final task will be added to each:
        ```markdown
        - [ ] **Final Step: Commit Changes**
          - [ ] Commit all changes to the current branch with a descriptive message (e.g., "P2A: App version and user routes complete").
        ```

Let's apply these changes.

Okay, I've updated `.claude/spec/P1-core.md` to use `pnpm` and to include a commit step at the end of Phase 1.

Now, I'll add a final commit step to each of the P2 plan files:

*   `.claude/spec/P2A-users-app.md`
*   `.claude/spec/P2B-auth-blog.md`
*   `.claude/spec/P2C-oauth.md`
*   `.claude/spec/P2D-admin-stripe-etc.md`


Okay, I've added the commit step to `P2A-users-app.md`. Now, I'll add the final commit step to the remaining P2 plan files.


Okay, I've added the commit step to `P2B-auth-blog.md`. Now for `P2C-oauth.md`.
Okay, I've added the commit step to `P2C-oauth.md`. Now for `P2D-admin-stripe-etc.md`.
Okay, this is an advanced workflow that requires careful coordination between your terminal, git commands, and multiple Claude Code sessions to achieve the parallel execution you're looking for.

Hereâ€™s the plan:

1.  **Plan Files Updated**: Your `.claude/spec/*.md` files have been updated to use `pnpm` and include commit steps.
2.  **New Bash Script**: I will now create a bash script to help set up the parallel worktrees for the P2 (API porting) phases. This script will be run *after* the P1 (core setup) phase is complete for each of your two target versions.
3.  **Detailed Execution Flow**: I'll then walk you through the commands and steps for one full version. You can repeat this flow for the second version. For true parallelism of the P2 sub-tasks (P2A, P2B, P2C, P2D), you will need to run multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously.

**Step 2: Create Bash Script for P2 Worktree Setup**

I'll create the file `.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh`. This script will take the main branch name of a version (e.g., `flask-migration-v1-0`) as an argument and create four new worktrees, each with a new branch based on that main branch, for the parallel P2 tasks.


Okay, this is an advanced workflow designed for maximum parallelism. It requires careful management of git worktrees, branches, and potentially multiple Claude Code instances running simultaneously.

Here's the comprehensive plan:

**Recap of Preparations:**

1.  **Plan Files Updated**: Your `.claude/spec/*.md` plan files have been updated to use `pnpm` for package management and include explicit "commit changes" steps at the end of each major phase (P1, P2A, P2B, P2C, P2D).
2.  **New Bash Script**: The script `.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh` has been created. This script is crucial for setting up the parallel worktrees for the P2 (API route porting) sub-tasks.
3.  **Custom Commands Ready**: You have `@/init-parallel` and `@/execute-single-plan` available in your Claude Code environment.

**Workflow for Each Version (e.g., Version 1 - "flask-migration-v1")**

You will repeat this entire workflow for "Version 2" (e.g., "flask-migration-v2").

**Phase A: Initial Setup & Core Services (P1)**

1.  **Start Claude Code**:
    Open your terminal in your project root directory (`/Users/jdehorty/src/ai-edge-docs`).
    Type:
    ```bash
    claude
    ```
    This starts your main Claude Code session.

2.  **Initialize Primary Worktree for Version 1**:
    Inside the Claude Code session, run:
    ```
    @/init-parallel "flask-migration-v1" 1
    ```
    *   **Action**: This command will create a primary worktree and a new branch for your first version.
    *   **Output**: Pay close attention to the output. It will tell you the path to the new worktree (e.g., `./trees/flask-migration-v1-0/`) and the name of the new branch (e.g., `flask-migration-v1-0`).
    *   **Record These**: Let's call these `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH` (e.g., `./trees/flask-migration-v1-0`) and `MAIN_V1_BRANCH` (e.g., `flask-migration-v1-0`). You'll need these exact names.

3.  **Execute P1 Plan (Core Setup & Services)**:
    In the same Claude Code session, run:
    ```
    @/execute-single-plan "{{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}" ".claude/spec/P1-core.md"
    ```
    (Replace `{{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}` with the actual path you recorded, e.g., `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/flask-migration-v1-0" ".claude/spec/P1-core.md"`)
    *   **Action**: Claude will execute the foundational setup and port core services within the `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH`. The last step of this plan is to commit these changes to the `MAIN_V1_BRANCH`.
    *   **Wait for completion.**

**Phase B: Setup for Parallel P2 Tasks (API Route Porting)**

1.  **Make Bash Script Executable (One-time setup)**:
    Open a *new, regular terminal window* (not inside Claude Code). Navigate to your project root.
    Run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x .claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh
    ```

2.  **Run the Bash Script to Create P2 Worktrees**:
    In the *same regular terminal*, from your project root, execute the script. Provide the `MAIN_V1_BRANCH` name you recorded as an argument:
    ```bash
    ./.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh {{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}
    ```
    (e.g., `./.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh flask-migration-v1-0`)
    *   **Action**: This script creates four new git worktrees and corresponding branches, all based on the current state of `MAIN_V1_BRANCH` (which has P1 completed and committed).
    *   **Output**: The script will list the paths and branch names for the P2 tasks:
        *   `P2A` worktree: e.g., `./trees/P2A-flask-migration-v1-0/` on branch `P2A-flask-migration-v1-0`
        *   `P2B` worktree: e.g., `./trees/P2B-flask-migration-v1-0/` on branch `P2B-flask-migration-v1-0`
        *   `P2C` worktree: e.g., `./trees/P2C-flask-migration-v1-0/` on branch `P2C-flask-migration-v1-0`
        *   `P2D` worktree: e.g., `./trees/P2D-flask-migration-v1-0/` on branch `P2D-flask-migration-v1-0`
    *   **Record these four worktree paths.**

**Phase C: Execute P2 Tasks in Parallel**

This is where true parallelism happens. You'll need **four separate Claude Code instances**, ideally in four different terminal windows/tabs.

1.  **Terminal/Claude Instance 1 (for P2A)**:
    *   In a new terminal, start Claude Code: `claude`
    *   Run P2A plan: `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/P2A-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}" ".claude/spec/P2A-users-app.md"`
      (e.g., `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/P2A-flask-migration-v1-0" ".claude/spec/P2A-users-app.md"`)

2.  **Terminal/Claude Instance 2 (for P2B)**:
    *   In a new terminal, start Claude Code: `claude`
    *   Run P2B plan: `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/P2B-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}" ".claude/spec/P2B-auth-blog.md"`

3.  **Terminal/Claude Instance 3 (for P2C)**:
    *   In a new terminal, start Claude Code: `claude`
    *   Run P2C plan: `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/P2C-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}" ".claude/spec/P2C-oauth.md"`

4.  **Terminal/Claude Instance 4 (for P2D)**:
    *   In a new terminal, start Claude Code: `claude`
    *   Run P2D plan: `@/execute-single-plan "./trees/P2D-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}" ".claude/spec/P2D-admin-stripe-etc.md"`

    *   **Action**: Each Claude instance will independently work on its assigned P2 plan in its dedicated worktree. Each P2 plan ends with a commit to its specific branch (e.g., `P2A-flask-migration-v1-0`).
    *   **Monitor and wait for all four instances to complete.**

**Phase D: Merge Parallel P2 Tasks into Main V1 Branch**

Once all four P2 tasks are complete and committed in their respective branches:

1.  **Open a regular terminal** (not Claude Code) in your project root.
2.  **Navigate into your Main V1 Worktree**:
    ```bash
    cd {{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}
    ```
    (e.g., `cd ./trees/flask-migration-v1-0`)
    Alternatively, you can stay in the root and ensure your main `.git` directory knows about all branches. The safest is usually to operate from within a worktree that is on the target branch for merges.
    Ensure you are on the `MAIN_V1_BRANCH`:
    ```bash
    git checkout {{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}
    ```
3.  **Merge each P2 branch**:
    ```bash
    git merge P2A-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}} --no-ff -m "Merge P2A: App version and user routes for V1"
    git merge P2B-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}} --no-ff -m "Merge P2B: Auth/Me and blog comment routes for V1"
    git merge P2C-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}} --no-ff -m "Merge P2C: OAuth and auth callback routes for V1"
    git merge P2D-{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}} --no-ff -m "Merge P2D: Admin, Stripe, and other routes for V1"
    ```
    (Replace `{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}` with the actual branch name, e.g., `P2A-flask-migration-v1-0`)
    *   **Action**: This integrates the work from all parallel P2 tasks into your `MAIN_V1_BRANCH`.
    *   **Conflict Resolution**: Be prepared to resolve merge conflicts. While the tasks are mostly separate, there could be overlaps (e.g., in shared schema files or utility functions).

**Phase E: Finalization (P3)**

1.  **Return to a Claude Code session** (you can use your initial one or start a new one).
2.  **Execute P3 Plan in the Main V1 Worktree**:
    ```
    @/execute-single-plan "{{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}" ".claude/spec/P3-final.md"
    ```
    *   **Action**: Claude runs the final verification, linting, cleanup, and prompts for human review steps on the now fully integrated `MAIN_V1_BRANCH`.

**Version 1 is now Complete!**

**Workflow for Version 2 (e.g., "flask-migration-v2")**

To create your second, independent version:

*   **Repeat Phases A through E entirely**, substituting "v1" with "v2" in all relevant names.
    *   Start with `@/init-parallel "flask-migration-v2" 1`. This will create `MAIN_V2_WORKTREE_PATH` (e.g., `./trees/flask-migration-v2-0/`) and `MAIN_V2_BRANCH` (e.g., `flask-migration-v2-0`).
    *   Run the P2 setup script with `MAIN_V2_BRANCH`.
    *   Execute P2 tasks in parallel for branches like `P2A-flask-migration-v2-0`, etc.
    *   Merge into `MAIN_V2_BRANCH`.
    *   Finalize with P3 in `MAIN_V2_WORKTREE_PATH`.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Resource Intensive**: Running multiple Claude Code instances can be resource-intensive on your machine.
*   **Git Proficiency**: This workflow requires a good understanding of git worktrees, branching, and merging. Carefully track your branch names and worktree paths.
*   **Error Handling**: If a Claude Code session fails during one of the P2 tasks, you'll need to address the issue in that specific worktree and branch, ensure changes are committed, and then proceed.
*   **Cleanup (Optional, After Everything)**: Once you've chosen your preferred version and merged it, you can clean up unused worktrees and branches:
    *   `git worktree remove ./trees/some-worktree-path`
    *   `git branch -D some-branch-name`
    (Do this with caution, ensuring you don't delete work you need).

This detailed approach provides the highest degree of parallelism for the P2 tasks, which are likely the most time-consuming. Remember to replace placeholders like `{{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}` and `{{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}` with the actual names you observe during the process.

**Cursor**

This is indeed a comprehensive and well-structured plan for achieving parallel execution of your P2 migration tasks. The preparatory steps, including updating the plan files and creating the `.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh` script, appear to be complete according to your description.

The detailed workflow you've outlined for each version, from Phase A (Initial Setup) through Phase E (Finalization), provides a clear path forward. This approach, utilizing git worktrees and multiple Claude Code instances, is well-suited for the parallel processing you're aiming for.

I understand the execution of these phases now rests on your actions in the terminal and Claude Code sessions. I'm ready to assist if you encounter any issues or have questions as you proceed with these steps. Please let me know when you're ready to begin or if you need clarification on any part of the plan.

look up online if its possible to do this exact workflow only using claude in headless mode (that way it can all be done from Cursor's Agent) @Web

**Cursor**

Based on the "Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding" article from `anthropic.com`, it is indeed possible to adapt your complex parallel workflow to be orchestrated using Claude Code in headless mode, which could then potentially be managed by Cursor's Agent. However, it's important to clarify how this would work:

Instead of a single headless Claude Code instance managing the entire parallel workflow internally, the Cursor Agent would act as a "custom harness" (a concept mentioned in section 6.d of the article). This means the Agent would be responsible for:

1.  **Launching multiple, independent `claude -p "prompt"` instances** for different phases and tasks.
2.  **Sequencing operations**: For example, ensuring P1 completes before starting the P2 worktree setup, and P2 tasks complete before merging.
3.  **Managing concurrency**: Launching the four P2 tasks (P2A, P2B, P2C, P2D) as concurrent headless Claude Code processes.
4.  **Passing context and parameters**: Constructing specific prompts for each headless instance, including necessary details like worktree paths and plan file locations. The functionality of your custom commands like `@/init-parallel` and `@/execute-single-plan` would need to be translated into detailed prompts passed to headless instances.
5.  **Capturing output and managing state**: For instance, getting the worktree paths output by one step to use as input for subsequent steps. Headless instances can be prompted to return specific strings (e.g., "OK" or "FAIL") to indicate completion status, which the Agent would monitor.

Here's how the phases might look with the Agent orchestrating headless Claude Code instances:

*   **Phase A (P1 - Core Setup)**:
    *   The Agent would construct a prompt that replicates the logic of `@/init-parallel "flask-migration-v1" 1` and execute it using `claude -p "<prompt_for_init>" --allowedTools Bash(git:*) ...`.
    *   The Agent would parse the output to get `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH` and `MAIN_V1_BRANCH`.
    *   Then, the Agent would construct a prompt replicating `@/execute-single-plan "{{MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH}}" ".claude/spec/P1-core.md"` and execute it via `claude -p "<prompt_for_p1_execution>" --allowedTools Edit Bash(git:*) ...`. The prompt would need to ensure operations occur within the correct worktree.

*   **Phase B (P2 Worktree Setup)**:
    *   The Agent would either run the `/.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh {{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}` script directly (if it has shell execution capabilities) or prompt a headless Claude instance to do so: `claude -p "Run the script ./.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh {{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}" --allowedTools Bash(...)`.
    *   The Agent would capture the output to get the paths for the P2A, P2B, P2C, and P2D worktrees.

*   **Phase C (Parallel P2 Tasks)**:
    *   For each of the four P2 tasks, the Agent would:
        *   Construct a prompt replicating `@/execute-single-plan "{{P2x_WORKTREE_PATH}}" ".claude/spec/P2x-plan.md"`.
        *   Launch a *separate, concurrent* headless Claude instance: `claude -p "<prompt_for_p2x_execution>" --allowedTools Edit Bash(git:*) ...`.
    *   The Agent would need to manage these four concurrent processes and wait for their completion signals. This "fanning out" approach is described in section 6.d of the article.

*   **Phase D (Merge Parallel P2 Tasks)**:
    *   The Agent would sequentially issue commands (either directly or via headless Claude prompts) to `cd` into `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH`, `git checkout {{MAIN_V1_BRANCH}}`, and perform the `git merge` operations for each P2 branch.

*   **Phase E (Finalization - P3)**:
    *   Similar to P1 execution, the Agent would prompt a headless Claude instance to execute the P3 plan within the `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH`.

**Key Considerations from the Article:**

*   **`--allowedTools`**: The Agent would need to specify necessary permissions (e.g., `Edit`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(./path/to/script:*)`) for each headless invocation to ensure non-interactive execution.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: The prompts given to headless Claude instances would need to be very clear and self-contained, including all necessary context (like target file paths or directories for operations), as each `claude -p` call starts with a fresh context.
*   **Task Signaling**: Prompts should instruct Claude to output specific signals (e.g., "TASK_COMPLETE_SUCCESS", "TASK_COMPLETE_ERROR: [details]") so the Agent can track progress and handle errors.
*   **Git Worktrees**: Section 6.c explicitly supports using multiple Claude instances with git worktrees, which aligns perfectly with your strategy. For headless mode, the Agent would manage launching Claude instances configured to operate within these distinct worktrees.

In summary, yes, this workflow can be automated using headless Claude Code, but it relies on an external orchestrator (Cursor's Agent in your case) to manage the sequence, parallelism, and state of multiple headless `claude -p` invocations. This aligns with the "custom harness" concept for headless mode described in the Anthropic engineering article.

**User**

Ok let's do it...remember to always use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`

---

**Cursor**

Okay, let's proceed with this advanced workflow using headless Claude instances. I will ensure all `claude` CLI calls use the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag as you've requested.

We'll start with **Phase A: Initial Setup & Core Services (P1)** for the first version, which we'll call `flask-migration-v1`.

I'll define the following:
*   `VERSION_NAME = "flask-migration-v1"`
*   `MAIN_V1_BRANCH = "flask-migration-v1-0"`
*   `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH = "./trees/flask-migration-v1-0"`
*   `P1_PLAN_PATH = ".claude/spec/P1-core.md"`

I will now initiate two commands. These commands use `claude -p "..."` to perform the necessary actions. The first command will set up the git worktree and branch for P1. The second command will execute the P1 plan tasks within that worktree.

**Command 1: Initialize P1 Worktree**
This command instructs Claude to create the directory `./trees` (if it doesn't exist) and then set up a new git worktree at `./trees/flask-migration-v1-0` with a new branch `flask-migration-v1-0` based on your current HEAD.

I am now running the command to initialize the P1 worktree.

My apologies, the previous command failed because the prompt string contained newline characters, which is not allowed for the `command` argument. I'll correct that.

I will now re-run the command to initialize the P1 worktree with the prompt on a single line.

The P1 worktree and branch `flask-migration-v1-0` have been successfully created at `./trees/flask-migration-v1-0`.

Now, I'll execute the P1 plan within this worktree.

**Command 2: Execute P1 Plan**
This command instructs a headless Claude instance to perform the tasks outlined in `.claude/spec/P1-core.md`. All operations will be relative to the `MAIN_V1_WORKTREE_PATH` (`./trees/flask-migration-v1-0`). The plan includes installing dependencies with `pnpm` and committing the changes to the `flask-migration-v1-0` branch.

I am now running the command to execute the P1 plan.

The P1 execution command has been backgrounded. This means I cannot see its progress or confirm its completion directly.

Please monitor the process that was "popped out". Once it has finished and you have confirmed that the P1 tasks (including dependency installation and the final commit with the message "P1: Core services and environment setup complete" on branch `flask-migration-v1-0` within the `./trees/flask-migration-v1-0` worktree) are successfully completed, please let me know.

After you confirm P1 completion, I will proceed with **Phase B: Setup for Parallel P2 Tasks**, which involves running the `.claude/scripts/setup_parallel_p2_worktrees.sh` script.
